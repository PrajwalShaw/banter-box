//flex-1: This tells the div to grow and take up the remaining available space in the parent container. 
//It means this element will expand to fill up the remaining space in its flex parent (if there is any).

//gap-3: This adds a 3-unit gap (which is usually 0.75rem or 12px by default) between the
// flex items (the <p> and <span> in this case). It ensures that the items are separated by some space.
